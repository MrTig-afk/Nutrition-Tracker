# 🥗 Nutrition Tracker – A Personal Solution to a Real Problem

Tracking calories used to be a **tedious and time-consuming task** — one I personally struggled with.  
This project was born out of that frustration.

I'm building a **nutrition tracker** powered by:

- 🧠 **Open-source OCR** for reading nutrition labels  
- 👁️ **Computer Vision techniques** for image preprocessing and augmentation  
- 🗂️ **OpenFoodFacts API** to fetch standardized nutritional data  

The goal is to make calorie tracking **simple, fast, and automated**.
